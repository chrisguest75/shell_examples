Demonstrate how to monitor a folder for changes using `inotify` or `watchman`.  

## Reason

It's a common requirement that a process needs to monitor the output of another process via the filesystem.  File notification systems are generally OS specific.

* Demonstrate how to monitor a folder for changes using `watchman` [here]
