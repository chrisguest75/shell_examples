# DOTSOURCING

Demonstrate how to use dot-sourcing.  

## Reason

The ability to dot source scripts gives us the ability to merge scripts into shell sessions.  

## Example

```sh
# no dot sourced
./test-dotsource.sh            
```

```sh
# attempted to the dot sourced
. ./test-dotsource.sh            
```
