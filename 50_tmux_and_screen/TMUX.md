Demonstrate some `tmux` examples and common commands.  

## Background

tmux, short for "terminal multiplexer", is a powerful command-line tool used in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It provides several functionalities that are extremely useful for users who work extensively with terminal sessions, especially when managing multiple tasks or connections simultaneously. Here's a breakdown of its key purposes and features:  

* Multiple Terminal Sessions in a Single Window: tmux allows you to create, manage, and navigate multiple terminal sessions from a single window. This is particularly useful for users who work on servers or remote machines via the command line.  

* Persistent Sessions: One of the primary features of tmux is its ability to maintain persistent sessions. This means you can start a session, detach from it, and then reattach later, with all your work preserved. This is especially useful for running long-term processes on a remote server.  

* Splitting Windows: tmux supports splitting the terminal window into multiple panes, both horizontally and vertically. This allows you to view and work in several shells simultaneously within the same window.  

* Customizable Status Bar: The status bar at the bottom of the tmux window provides useful information like session names, window lists, and can even display system information. It's highly customizable.  

* Scripting and Automation: Advanced users can write scripts for tmux to automate repetitive tasks, making their workflow more efficient.  

* Session Sharing: tmux sessions can be shared between multiple users, which is useful for collaborative work or for educational purposes where one might need to demonstrate commands and processes in real-time.  

* Enhanced Navigation: With tmux, you can easily navigate between different windows and panes, which is a big productivity boost compared to using multiple terminal windows or tabs.  

* Buffer and Clipboard Management: tmux allows you to copy text within a pane and paste it into another pane or window, providing an internal clipboard functionality.  

* Customization and Configuration: Users can customize almost every aspect of tmux, from keybindings to appearance, through a .tmux.conf file in the user's home directory.

* tmux in iterm

## Configuration

Example in my dotfiles [here](https://github.com/chrisguest75/default_dotfiles/blob/master/tmux/.tmux.conf)

```sh
cat ~/.tmux.conf
```

## Sessions

```sh
# version of tmux
tmux -V

# Start new session with directory name
tmux new -s $(basename $(pwd))

# list open sessions
tmux list-sessions 
tmux ls	

# attach to a particular session
tmux attach -t <name>

# kill a session and all windows
tmux kill-session -t <name>
```
